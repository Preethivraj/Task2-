# Task2-
Automated Report Generation

🧠 About the Task: This task is to create a Python program that reads data from a CSV file and automatically creates a PDF report using that data.

I used:

pandas – to read and analyze the data
fpdf – to create the PDF
📥 Input File: CSV file with student names, departments and their scores.

Example content:

Name,Department,Score Nithish,CSE,85 Vishalini,IT,90 Ravi,ECE,75 Anu,EEE,82

⚙️ What the Code Does:

Reads the CSV file using pandas
Calculates average score, highest score, and who is the topper
Displays all student data in the PDF
Creates a file named Student_Report.pdf
▶️ How to Run:

Make sure you have Python installed.
Install required libraries if not already: pip install pandas fpdf
Keep both .py file and sample_data.csv in the same folder.
Run the Python file. You will get the final report as a PDF in the same folder.
📄 Output:

A clean PDF with title, stats, and full student data.
